# Implementing Page Ranking Algorithm
The PageRank algorithm is implemented with and without random teleportations using the following method â€“
Finding the principal left eigenvector of the probability transition matrix directly i.e., by making use of numerical linear algebra packages.
The hyperparameter used- Teleportation to a random page has probability of 0.1
